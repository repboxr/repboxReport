An analysis of the stack trace indicates the error `subscript out of bounds` occurs when accessing `wrong_num_msgs[[cid]]`. This type of error with a character-like subscript `cid` typically happens if `cid` is `NA`.

The `cid` variable comes from `all_conflict_cells`, which is a union of names from `mapping_conflict_msgs` and `wrong_num_msgs`. The names of these lists are `cell_id`s.

Looking at the creation of `wrong_num_msgs`, its names are derived from the `cell_id` column of `wrong_num_conflict_df`. This dataframe is created by unnesting the `wrong_number_cases` list-column from the map data. If the `cell_id` within `wrong_number_cases` is `null` in the source JSON, it can be parsed as an `NA` value in R. The code that creates `wrong_num_conflict_df` does not filter out these `NA` values for `cell_id` before grouping by them. The `dplyr::group_by` function will create a group for `NA` values, which results in `NA` being present in the `cell_id` column of `wrong_num_conflict_df` and subsequently as a name in the `wrong_num_msgs` list.

When `lapply` then iterates over `all_conflict_cells`, `cid` becomes `NA`, and `wrong_num_msgs[[NA]]` throws the "subscript out of bounds" error.

To fix this, I will add a `dplyr::filter(!is.na(cell_id))` step to the pipeline that creates `wrong_num_conflict_df`, ensuring that any `NA` `cell_id`s are removed before they can be used for grouping and naming.
