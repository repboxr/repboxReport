Of course. Storing metadata like test descriptions directly within the data object (`rme.Rds`) is an excellent way to make your reporting tools more robust and easier to maintain. This avoids the need to update the reporting code every time a new evaluation test is added or a description is refined in the `repboxRegmap` package.

Here are the proposed changes to `repboxReport` to implement this. The core idea is to:
1.  Update and expand the internal list of test descriptions in `report_map.R` to include the new `missing_se_mapping` test and to align all descriptions with the more detailed versions from `rme_report.R`. This ensures reports still work correctly with older `rme.Rds` files.
2.  Modify the logic to prioritize loading descriptions from the `rme.Rds` object itself (if present) before falling back to the internal list. This change anticipates that future versions of `rme.Rds` will contain a `long_descr` attribute for each test.

This approach solves the immediate problem and provides a future-proof, automatic mechanism for handling new tests.

Here is the modification for `rr_process_eval_data`:

!MODIFICATION rr_process_eval_data in report_map.R
scope = "function"
file = "R/report_map.R"
function_name = "rr_process_eval_data"
description = '''Update the function to make evaluation reporting more robust.

1.  **Update and expand the internal `long_descriptions` list**:
    -   Adds the description for the new `missing_se_mapping` test.
    -   Updates all other descriptions to be more detailed and consistent with those in `repboxRegmap`, ensuring clarity in the report.
2.  **Implement dynamic description loading**:
    -   The function now first attempts to load a `long_descr` attribute from the test data within the `rme.Rds` object.
    -   If not found, it falls back to the internal (now updated) `long_descriptions` list.
    -   This makes the reporting logic automatically adapt to new tests and descriptions provided in future `rme.Rds` files, answering the user's request for a more automated system.'''
